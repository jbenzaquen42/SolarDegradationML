# SolarDegradationML
Creation on model for degrigation from NREL Dataset

## Introduction
`SolarDegradationML` is a data science project aimed at analyzing solar panel performance and degradation rates over time. This project employs Python and Jupyter Notebooks to clean data, perform exploratory data analysis, and build predictive models with the goal of identifying key factors influencing solar panel degradation and predicting future performance.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you meet the following requirements:
- Python 3.7 or higher installed
- Familiarity with pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn libraries
- Basic knowledge of Git and GitHub for version control

## Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone <https://github.com/yourusername/SolarDegradationML.git](https://github.com/jbenzaquen42/SolarDegradationML.git>
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd SolarDegradationML
3. Install the required Python libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
To use `SolarDegradationML`, follow these steps:
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab in the project directory.
2. Open the `SolarPanelDegradationAnalysis.ipynb` notebook.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to perform the analysis.
